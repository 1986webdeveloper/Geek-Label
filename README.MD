# Geek-Label Theme

This theme is been worked as a part of bonus task of the test.

Though, I have not integrated it in drupal, I have created SASS based bootstrap html to make it.
For CSS I have used BEM methodology. Prepos is used for SASS compilation of the project css files. Theme is tested on latest browsers like, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and with IE11. Bootstrap is used as parent theme.

For Slider, I have used OwlSlider.
For Map, I have used google Map API.
